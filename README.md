Homework 1 Coding revising


Description

In this project I was given source code that I had to optimize in order for the webpage to meet accessablity standards. This included adding semantic elements, creating alt attributes, and making sure heading attributes fell in sequential oder. I also made sure the title element contained a concise, descriptive title.
